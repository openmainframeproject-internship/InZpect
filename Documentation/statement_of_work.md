## Project Description
Inzpect is a project aimed at providing a debugger functionality to Z assembler code over code editors like VS code and Eclipse Theia with the help of Debugger Adapter Protocol.

## State of Project

### Current State
- There is no DAP for the Z assembler code.
- Debugger is being implemented in Java and some features are already done.

### Value of InZpect
- This will provide an easy to use debugging feature for developers working on Z assembler code.
- Can set breakpoints and other debugging feature while working on Z assembler code remotely.
- DAP can then be used for multiple editors. Example: VS code and Eclipse Theia.

### Project Requirement
- Build DAP, which will work with the Inzpect backend being written in Java.
- It should work for both VS code and Eclipse Theia.
